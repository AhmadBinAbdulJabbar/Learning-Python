## Projects

### 1. Simple Calculator

- **Location:** `1.calculator/Simple Calculator/`
- **Description:**
  - A basic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Features a clear ASCII-art interface and keyboard-driven input.
  - Great for learning Python basics, user input, and string manipulation.
  - See the [Simple Calculator README](./1.calculator/Simple%20Calculator/README.md) for details.

### 2. Scientific Calculator

- **Location:** `1.calculator/Scientific Calculator/`
- **Description:**
  - A feature-rich scientific calculator supporting a wide range of mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, powers, factorial, etc.) and constants (`pi`, `e`, `tau`).
  - Uses Python's `math` module and safe evaluation for expressions.
  - Includes a help system, error handling, and an ASCII-art UI.
  - See the [Scientific Calculator README](./1.calculator/Scientific%20Calculator/README.md) for full features and usage.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Navigate to the project folder you want to run.
3. Run the calculator script in your terminal:

   ```sh
   python simple_calculator.py  # For the simple calculator
   python scientific_calculator.py  # For the scientific calculator
   ```
