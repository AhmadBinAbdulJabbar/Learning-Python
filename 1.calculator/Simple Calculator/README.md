# Simple Calculator (Terminal-Based)

This is a basic terminal-based calculator written in Python. It allows you to perform simple arithmetic operations with a user-friendly ASCII-art interface.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Integer and decimal number support
- Clear and exit options
- Easy-to-use keyboard input
- ASCII-art calculator display

## How to Use

1. Run `simple_calculator.py` in your terminal:

   ```sh
   python simple_calculator.py
   ```

2. Enter numbers and operators as prompted.
3. Use the displayed keys to perform calculations, clear the screen, or exit.

## Example Operations

- `5 + 3`
- `12.5 * 4`
- `10 / 2`
- `7 - 2`

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies

## What I Used and Learned

- **Python basics:** Variables, functions, loops, and conditionals
- **User input:** Handling keyboard input in the terminal
- **ASCII art:** Designing a calculator interface using print statements
- **String manipulation:** Building and updating the expression as the user types, and evaluating the final string expression to perform the calculation when the user presses '='. The calculator parses the input as a string, processes each character, and computes the result based on the constructed expression.
- **Basic error handling:** Preventing invalid operations (like division by zero)
- **Modular code:** Organizing code into functions for clarity and reuse
- **Terminal applications:** Creating interactive programs that run in the command line
