# Library Management System

A terminal-based Python application to manage books, members, borrowing, returning, and book reviews in a library. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction.

## Features

- **Add Book:** Add new books with title, author, ISBN, and optional category.
- **Register Member:** Register new library members with a unique member ID.
- **Issue Book:** Issue available books to members (with borrowing limits).
- **Return Book:** Return borrowed books and calculate fines for late returns.
- **Remove Book/Member:** Remove books (if not issued) and members (if no books borrowed).
- **List Available/Issued Books:** View all available or currently issued books.
- **Search Book:** Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Book Reviews:** View and add reviews and ratings for books.
- **Statistics:** View total books, available/issued books, and total members.
- **Automated Testing:** Includes a `test()` function to verify all core features.
